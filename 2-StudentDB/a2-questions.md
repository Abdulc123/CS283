## Assignment 2 Questions

#### Directions
Please answer the following questions and submit in your repo for the second assignment.  Please keep the answers as short and concise as possible.

1. In this assignment I asked you provide an implementation for the `get_student(...)` function because I think it improves the overall design of the database application.   After you implemented your solution do you agree that externalizing `get_student(...)` into it's own function is a good design strategy?  Briefly describe why or why not.

    > **Answer**: I believe that creating a seperate function for get_student is a really good deisng strategy because it makes the code more readable and concise. There is no repeated code in each of the other functions that is just checking to see a student is in the database or not. If we were to not care about duplicated code, just having that code there would also make it harder to undertand what the entire function is doing. Most functions should follow the SRP (Single Responsibility Principle), using other functions that do a specific thing is how you can make clean, reusable code that is easier to scale. Less time trying to undertand what a repeated piece of code is doing overtime can allow for more beneficial improvements to be made. 

2. Another interesting aspect of the `get_student(...)` function is how its function prototype requires the caller to provide the storage for the `student_t` structure:

    ```c
    int get_student(int fd, int id, student_t *s);
    ```

    Notice that the last parameter is a pointer to storage **provided by the caller** to be used by this function to populate information about the desired student that is queried from the database file. This is a common convention (called pass-by-reference) in the `C` programming language. 

    In other programming languages an approach like the one shown below would be more idiomatic for creating a function like `get_student()` (specifically the storage is provided by the `get_student(...)` function itself):

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t student;
        bool student_found = false;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found)
            return &student;
        else
            return NULL;
    }
    ```
    Can you think of any reason why the above implementation would be a **very bad idea** using the C programming language?  Specifically, address why the above code introduces a subtle bug that could be hard to identify at runtime? 

    > **ANSWER:** Within the modified function that returns a student_t address, this is generally a bad idea in C because the local variabel student_t student is allocated on the stack. When the return finally occurs, the function ends, resulting in the stack frame being destroyed (memory allocated for the student is no longer valid). When the caller tries to reference the data stored at the address with a pointer it will point to memory that has potentially been deallocated (meaning segmentation faults and corrupted data).

3. Another way the `get_student(...)` function could be implemented is as follows:

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND or memory allocation error: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t *pstudent;
        bool student_found = false;

        pstudent = malloc(sizeof(student_t));
        if (pstudent == NULL)
            return NULL;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found){
            return pstudent;
        }
        else {
            free(pstudent);
            return NULL;
        }
    }
    ```
    In this implementation the storage for the student record is allocated on the heap using `malloc()` and passed back to the caller when the function returns. What do you think about this alternative implementation of `get_student(...)`?  Address in your answer why it work work, but also think about any potential problems it could cause.  
    
    > **ANSWER:** This will work since you are creeating a pointer and alloccating space for it using malloc. When the function returns the pointer, since the pointer is allocated on the heap the memory will not be deallocated. Some downsides of this implementation is that since you are allocating memory for the pstudent pointer using malloc it will be allocated on the heap. Even when the function completes, the memory will not be deallocated and will persist and continue taking up space on the heap until the call frees it.If a user does try to access the pointer after freeing it, this could result in undfined behvaior and hard to find bugs. 


4. Lets take a look at how storage is managed for our simple database. Recall that all student records are stored on disk using the layout of the `student_t` structure (which has a size of 64 bytes).  Lets start with a fresh database by deleting the `student.db` file using the command `rm ./student.db`.  Now that we have an empty database lets add a few students and see what is happening under the covers.  Consider the following sequence of commands:

    ```bash
    > ./sdbsc -a 1 john doe 345
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 128 Jan 17 10:01 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 3 jane doe 390
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 256 Jan 17 10:02 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 63 jim doe 285 
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 64 janet doe 310
    > du -h ./student.db
        8.0K    ./student.db
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 4160 Jan 17 10:03 ./student.db
    ```

    For this question I am asking you to perform some online research to investigate why there is a difference between the size of the file reported by the `ls` command and the actual storage used on the disk reported by the `du` command.  Understanding why this happens by design is important since all good systems programmers need to understand things like how linux creates sparse files, and how linux physically stores data on disk using fixed block sizes.  Some good google searches to get you started: _"lseek syscall holes and sparse files"_, and _"linux file system blocks"_.  After you do some research please answer the following:

    - Please explain why the file size reported by the `ls` command was 128 bytes after adding student with ID=1, 256 after adding student with ID=3, and 4160 after adding the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** The ls command reports the logical size of the file (total number of bytes written to the file, even if the bytes are physically stored in the disk) When the database file is created it starts empty. Adding student ID = 1 -> Grows to 128 bytes. Adding student ID = 3 (size is now 192 -> size has padding and becomes 256 bytes) Adding student ID = 64 -> size is now (64 * 64 = 4,096) with padding it will be set to max capacity of 4,160.
        

    -   Why did the total storage used on the disk remain unchanged when we added the student with ID=1, ID=3, and ID=63, but increased from 4K to 8K when we added the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** The disk space didn’t change for IDs 1, 3, and 63 because Linux filesystems use sparse files, so gaps (like missing IDs) don’t take up space. The disk usage increased from 4 KB to 8 KB after adding ID 64 because the first 4 KB block was full, and Linux allocates storage in fixed chunks (typically 4 KB). Adding ID 64 required a second block, doubling the usage.


    - Now lets add one more student with a large student ID number  and see what happens:

        ```bash
        > ./sdbsc -a 99999 big dude 205 
        > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 6400000 Jan 17 10:28 ./student.db
        > du -h ./student.db
        12K     ./student.db
        ```
        We see from above adding a student with a very large student ID (ID=99999) increased the file size to 6400000 as shown by `ls` but the raw storage only increased to 12K as reported by `du`.  Can provide some insight into why this happened?

        > **ANSWER:**  Adding a large ID like 99999 made the file size huge (6.4 MB) because the database creates gaps for all missing IDs. Linux uses sparse files, so these gaps don’t take up actual disk space. Only the parts of the file with real data (like ID 99999) use storage, which is why the disk usage only increased to 12 KB.
